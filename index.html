								<h3>Analysis of the impact of Education on the Health of the Population</h3>
								<p> We have taken advantage of the data collected by U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and
									obtained the Percentage of individuals over 65 years old that have Education (Bachelor or higher) per each State in the USA.
									We then collected the percentage of individuals over 65 years old that have had all their teeth removed
									and the percentage of individuals that have visited the doctor at least once in the past 2 years.
								</p>
								<p> The calculated correlation between Education and Teeth removed is -0.70 whereas the correlation between Education and Visit to
									the doctor is 0.67. </p>
